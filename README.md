## Problem Statement

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a growing concern with significant implications:

- **Impact**: Over 200,000 recreational water sites affected annually in the U.S., causing billions in economic losses in tourism, fishing, and water activities.
- **Health Risks**: Approximately 10,000 emergency room visits per year linked to algal bloom toxins.
- **Environmental Changes**: Rising temperatures and nutrient runoff projected to increase HAB events by 20% by 2050.
- **Case Studies**:
  - In 2014, Lake Erie issued a "do not drink" order for 500,000 due to toxic microcystin.
  - A 2019 algal bloom in Norway killed millions of farmed salmon.
  - Chesapeake Bay faces hypoxic "dead zones" linked to nutrient pollution.
  - The Great Lakes are increasingly threatened by HABs affecting water supplies.

## Market Opportunity

- **Market Size**: The U.S. market for HAB solutions is valued at approximately **$5.4 billion**.
- **Projected Growth**: Anticipated **CAGR of 6.8%** over the next five years.
- **Economic Impact**: Estimated annual impact of public health issues related to HABs ranges from **$10 to $100 million** across major cities.
